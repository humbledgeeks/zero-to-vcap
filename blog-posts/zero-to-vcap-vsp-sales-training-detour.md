# Zero to VCAP: When the Study Plan Takes a Detour (And It's Still Worth It)

Sometimes the cert journey doesn't go exactly the way you planned it.

This week was supposed to be a deep dive into the VCF 9.0 Administrator blueprint I outlined in my last post. But real life had other ideas.

As a VAR partner, our organization needed to complete VMware Cloud Foundation accreditations at the company level. Since these aligned directly with the platform I'm already studying, I made the call to take what I'm calling a productive detour.

Two accreditations. One week. And honestly — it was time well spent.

## VMware Sales Professional (VSP) – VCF 9.0

The first accreditation was the **VMware Sales Professional (VSP)** for VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0.

The curriculum is designed for sellers and presales engineers to confidently position VCF in customer conversations. It's structured in three stages.

### Stage 1 – Private Cloud Vision and Strategy

This stage is all about the "why." Why private cloud, why now, and why customers should care. It gives you the language to have that opening conversation before you ever get into a product demo.

As engineers, we tend to think in infrastructure terms. Customers think in outcomes. This stage helped reinforce that perspective shift.

### Stage 2 – Introducing VCF 9.0

Stage 2 focuses on VCF 9.0 itself — the new features, key components driving adoption, and how it fits into the broader market against competitors like **Red Hat OpenShift** and **Nutanix**.

This is where I'll be honest: I went in hoping for more content on the vSphere-to-VCF migration story — the "you've been on vSphere for a decade, here's why you should move to VCF" conversation. That's one I have regularly with customers.

Instead, the competitive positioning was primarily aimed at OpenShift and Nutanix. Genuinely useful, just not what I expected. I'll probably write a separate post on the vSphere migration angle down the road.

### Stage 3 – Customer Simulation

The final stage puts you into a real-world customer scenario. You're not just answering multiple choice questions — you have to position private cloud solutions, address customer challenges, and communicate platform value in context.

This part reinforced something I already believe but don't always practice perfectly:

Technical expertise alone isn't enough. You have to communicate the value clearly.

The VSP assessment is 58 questions plus the simulation-based evaluation, with an 80% passing requirement.

I'm glad to say I passed both. ✅

## VMware Technical Sales Professional (VTSP) – Solution Engineer Role

After finishing the VSP, I was already deep inside the VCF enablement track. So rather than switching context, I kept going.

The next accreditation is the **VMware Technical Sales Professional (VTSP)** — the Solution Engineer Role curriculum. This one moves past introductory conversations and prepares technical engineers to guide customers through hands-on VCF experiences.

### Stage 1 – Strategy and Platform Foundation

This stage expands on the private cloud strategy with deeper technical and financial discussions around VCF 9.0 — architecture, platform capabilities, and how to frame value for different customer personas.

### Stage 2 – Demonstrations and Use Cases

Stage 2 transitions into demonstration and solution positioning. It covers what's new in VCF 9.0 and introduces nine validated use cases organized around three initiatives:

- **Modernize Infrastructure**
- **Unified Cloud Experience**
- **Secure and Resilient Platform**

This stage also introduces VCF Advanced Services and how they support customer adoption.

### Stage 3 – Facilitating a VCF Experience Day

The final stage focuses on real customer engagement — specifically how to facilitate a VCF Hands-On Experience Day, guiding customers through live demonstrations and practical workflows.

I plan to have the VTSP wrapped up by this weekend.

## The Dual Hat Reality

Here's something that doesn't get talked about enough in partner training.

When I'm in a presales conversation, I'm thinking about business outcomes, licensing, and total cost of ownership. When I'm in delivery mode, I'm thinking about network requirements, cluster design, and SDDC Manager workflows.

Good training bridges both worlds. These accreditations lean heavily on the sales and positioning side — which makes sense given what they are. But for practitioners like me, the value is in the translation layer: taking what I know about VCF's competitive strengths and turning it into a technically credible conversation with a skeptical vSphere admin.

That skill set doesn't come from a curriculum. It comes from doing both jobs at the same time.

## Back to the Blueprint Next Week

This week was a necessary detour — but not a wasted one.

Both accreditations gave me a clearer picture of how VCF is positioned, sold, and adopted in the market. That context will be useful as I go deeper into the technical training. Understanding why customers buy the platform makes it easier to understand how to architect and operate it.

But next week, I'm getting back on the Zero to VCAP track.

The blueprint isn't going to study itself. The HOL labs are waiting.

If you're on your own cert journey and you hit a week like this — where the plan gets interrupted by work, training, or just life — don't sweat it.

Document it. Keep moving.

This is a real journey. Not a highlight reel.

Zero to VCAP continues. 🙂
